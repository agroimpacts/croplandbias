Changes:

* all datasets
Fixed NA rm approach in all datasets

* compare-cropland & landcover-bias-plots
Created new main figure showing bias with scale in cropland data. Added plot for counting bin length per aggregation class. 

* magisterial districts analysis
Corrected data to select only the MAE pixels co-located with non-zero reference cropland cover. Before it was all non-zero error. Output figures adjusted accordingly, but main shape stays (peak MAE closer to 50 than 60% however)

* carbon analysis
Re-run with updated NA approach.

* yield/production analysis
Re-run with updated NA approach.

* ET analysis
Re-run with updated NA approach.

* ABM analysis
Updated analysis includes land deficit parameter from new analysis using varying farm size distributions.
