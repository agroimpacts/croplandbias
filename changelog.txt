October 18, 2015, update 2

Changes:

* Updated ET bias
** Re-ran, checking statistics for density weighted bias/accuracy. All <2%, 
   so didn't make output table of these. Existing agricultural area 
   bias/accuracy retained, but probably not used in supplementals
   
* Revised intro through results of paper to match statistics update 
  and revised figures.  All but ABM section revised.
