Changes:

* Calculated density weighted cropland bias

* New functions to support this weighted bias

* Updated through carbon-bias 
  ** Density weighted bias/accuracy becomes 
     primary metric. 
  ** Removed density independent accuracy/bias metrics, removed graphical plots
     for everything not density weighted. 
  ** Cleaned-up bunch of commented out code.
