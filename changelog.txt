Changes:

* Updated yield/production bias
** Replaced assessment of adjusted cropland fraction bias/accuracy with 
   density-weighted variant. Removed whole country and agricultural-area bias
   variants. 
** Removed older variants of yield aggregation
** Replaced original muy calculations with density-weighted variant (which is 
   pretty much the same thing)
** Removed commented out p/ydiff2/3, and disaggregated versions of them.
** Added density-weighted error metrics as primary bias/accuracy method.
*** Upgraded check against rasters around line 998 to deal with NAs messing up 
    weighted.means (removed all NAs from raster stack I was checking against). 
    Allowed easier testing bias and absolute error.  
*** Redid plots, with density weighted as primary plot. Agricultural area 
    metrics retained for supplementals
*** Output tables combine density-weighted and agricultural area bias and 
    accuracy. 
    
* cropland-bias: 
** Cleaned up some bias/accuracy plotting code, renaming primary and 
   supplemental plots appropriately.
** Added check for cropland density categories between 2.5% and 97.5%.
