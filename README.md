# Overview

This R package contains the code, data, and manuscript source for Estes et al (2017) __A Large-Area, Spatially Continuous Assessment of Land Cover Map Error and Its Impact on Downstream Analyses__, accepted for publication (as of 8 September, 2017) by [Global Change Biology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2486).

All data (or, in the case of large open datasets [e.g. GLobCover 2009], links to download locations) and processing steps are contained in this package. For the two proprietary datasets used in this analysis, post-processed versions are provided here, and all analyses should be fully reproducible from that point forward. 

To install the package, use the following R commands
```
library(devtools)
install_github("agroimpacts/croplandbias", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
