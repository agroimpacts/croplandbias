The biases were calculated for several different levels of, ranging from the original 1 km resolution up to 300 km (only 1, 20, 50, and 100 km results are shown here). Blue areas are those where the landcover products underestimated croplands, and red areas are where they overestimated. The GlobCover and MODIS results are drawn from biases calculated from the intermediate cropland fraction estimates per pixel.}}{4}{figure.1}}

The top row shows biases at 1 km resolution for each of the four assessed landcover datasets, including the 2.5$^{th}$, 25$^{th}$, 50$^{th}$, 75$^{th}$, and 95$^{th}$ percentile values (grey box plots), as well as the means (colored lines). Rows 2-5 illustrate how mean biases for each landcover product (rows) changes in relation to the level of aggregation (columns). Mean biases greater than 40\% are truncated in order to improve plot clarity (the maximum truncated value is provided at the top right of each plot in grey).
